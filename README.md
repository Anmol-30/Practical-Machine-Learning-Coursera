# Practical-Machine-Learning-Coursera

**Outline**
This document is the final report of the Peer Assessment project from Courseraâ€™s course Practical Machine Learning, as part of the Specialization in Data Science. It was built up in RStudio, using its knitr functions, meant to be published in html format.
The report predicts the patterns/manner in which users of exercise devices exercise. The predictions are performed using various machine learning algorithms.

The dataset consists on 5 classes:
.Lifting weights according to the specification.This is Class A.
. Throwing the elbow towards the front. This is Class B.
